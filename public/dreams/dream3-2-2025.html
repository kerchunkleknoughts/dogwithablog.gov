<p>

  Another dream where I am walking around campus, I was in a pool, watching my little pony, this was combined with meeting rooms,<br>
   like a waterslide would go through the window of a meeting room and end in a pool, the pools were mostly empty, some of the support<br>
    beams were flimsy looking, made of thin metal poles. IT was late, members of the board of the college were meeting. Some levels <br>
    were detected to growing plants, on the water slide and there wasn't any room for people to swim. I went to go on the top level,<br>
     I think because I didn't want people to know I was watching mlp. There was just a pool at the top to hang out in<br>

      
When I was there, suddenly the supports snapped, and several of the floors started to wobble, eventually collapsing. With board<br>
 members, me and the water slide and all. I was worried since I might have harmed the board members, so I tried to hurry out of<br>
  there. I left as soon as I could, and into a room that looked like a hospital waiting room, completely empty, with the dual door<br>
   flaps. There was a board member sitting there, he said, you look like you are running from something, and he grabbed me before I<br>
    could leave, he then started to lecture me, do you know who I am? Blah blah blah, he then pulled out a DVD and put it in a cd <br>
    player which was about all of his life accomplishment. How he built large portions of the school, and so on. I then said sorry I<br>
     don't know who you are, but I have to get going maybe you don't understand my perspective and why I am running, then he smiled and<br>
      said well okay maybe I could get to know you, report back here Friday with a page long essay on your perspective and why you are<br>
       running, it was clear this man was trying to punish me somehow for the waterslide, or something, and I said no sir please I don't<br>
        have time for this I'm an engineering student this will be too much on top of my workload, and he smiled and said ah yes I was an<br>
         engineer once, he gave me his resume and I saw at the bottom he went to cornel, at this point I was getting mad, I said listen I<br>
          need to get going, I don't have time for your essay so I am not doing it, and I could even fucking sue you for your waterslide<br>
           giving out on me like that, and he was frowning now, I ran out as soon as I could, afraid he would track me down somehow, he<br>
            had some administrative authority somehow I just knew he would get me expelled. The building was a labyrinth, I was trying to<br>
             make it out so I could get to my car and go home. I ended outside somehow, but it was at the far end of the building, locked<br>
              with fences, it was right up next to an elementary school yard,<br>

 
The air was cold and the sky was full of stars. I remember looking at it with awe, and feeling refreshed.<br>

 
 and I was trying to find a gap in the fence to leave, there were children running around as I tried to locate<br>
  an exit. I saw [redacted] walking with Neal deGrasse Tyson, they were talking about science and advanced experiments<br>
   far above my understanding and [redacted] was clearly Nealâ€™s favorite student, I trailed behind them while they talked,<br>
    they badged into the building, and I came in behind them. <br>

 
I kept trying to look for an exit, I remember going down a slide thinking it would get me closer to leaving but it<br>
 turned out to be a laundry shoot, it led into a chamber with a giant spinning paddle, that was thrashing clothes about <br>
 and I spit out a huge wad of bubblegum to jam it before it could thrash and kill me. Of course I still couldn't get out<br>
  the slide was too slippery. <br>
