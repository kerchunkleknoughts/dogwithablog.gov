      This is just a placeholder for a game that I am working on right now,

      Overall game idea: an animal crossing/sims type game where you create a 
      little city for creatures to move into. The catch is they are all fucked up 
      looking and suffer from a variety of ailments. 
      
      That is the Overall jist, I am currently working on basic mechanics 
      and hope that as I progress on it I'll get more and more ideas 
      for the game, and if it doesnt turn out satistfactory, then 
      oh well I had a personal project for a while mission accomplished. 

      current controls:
      y adds money.
      m summons a house when moneu >50
      thats it. thats all folks. Its a WIP!
