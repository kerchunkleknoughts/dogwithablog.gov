    Had a dream that I was part of a group of time travelers. We went back to the great depression. 
 
There was some earlier plot I don't remember. I think I was helping someone with something. I ended 
up in this person's house, with their family, looking around I saw that they had a small personal
 computer, and was surprised since this was the great depression, I asked a little girl who was in
  the house, his daughter or granddaughter, how do you guys have this this is the great depression.
   It had a CRT screen, and a low refresh rate, you could see the refresh line travelling down the
    screen.
Under the supervision of time Cops we were looking around

 I was a little boy and I was talking to a little girl, and  I told her I was a time traveler,
  she begged me to tell her something about the future but I said it was against the rules. 
  Eventually her begging broke me down and I waited for a moment away from the time police's eyes,
   when we broke from their sight. There was a semitruck traveling with the crowd, and I tried moving 
   to the other side of it hoping there weren't any officers behind it, but there were. They looked like
    un peacekeepers, same uniform, equipped with m16 rifles. Eventually me and the girl got in front
     of the main group, we were traveling into a lush fall countryside at this point, and I told her
      to invest in apple. A moment passed and then I told her again, computers... just in case she 
      invested in actual apples. As I walked, I was thinking about the year and realized that she 
      herself might not live to see my advice become anything useful, and that her grandchildren
       might be the only ones who could use that information. I then began to worry that the advice 
       may never be useful, that she was just a little girl and she might forget. The countryside was
        beautiful. There were rolling hills punctuated with lone trees, and the lane I was running 
        down was sometimes shaded with sections of trees. It was warm, and the trees were all changing
         colors and the landscape was so colorful. I remember a hill with a single tree in the center,
          and leaves arranged around it to look line swirls, or spirals. I was running along, running so
           fast that I would sometimes trip and stumble. But I was running so fast that it didn't matter,
            I would roll and get back up on my feet again.
