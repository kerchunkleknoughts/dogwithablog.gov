One I was walking to my car, which was on the top of a hill, and I had a bunch of stuff with me, I had a fishing pole,
I was wearing the wrong kind of shoes, I think I had swimming shorts on, but despite all of these impairments I offered to
 walk [redacted] to his bus stop which was out of the way just because I wanted to talk the whole way and show him I cared.

At the school in the first day of class I was in a science class room, the lights were dimmed and the teacher passed out
 little about you quizzes for us to fill out, and there was also two cross word puzzles that he passed out to do as assignments.
  They were balatro themed. For some reason, I found the puzzles really difficult, so I was avoiding working on one of them, 
  stalling, so people couldn't see how hard of a time I was having with them. Eventually I was one of the few left in class,
   everyone was gone, they had finished because it was easy .  The lights were dimmed and there were a few clusters of students 
   just talking quietly. At one point the professor came over and said, are you going to work on this thing or keep slacking off?,
    I apologized and said I'd work on it.

Had a dream that I got lost while driving around, so I decided to go downtown to sort myself out and find where I was. I ended up
 driving to the airport, since I knew how to get home from a flight back to [redacted]. I was still in [redacted] when I stared the trip mind you. 

Anyway, When I got on the cockpit was empty and there was a sign that said the pilot was a minute late, I was standing next to an
 air stewart, which was also looking at the sign, scratched his chin and said hmmmm, then just climbed into the cockpit despite not
 being the pilot. 

I screamed at him NO YOU ARE NOT THE PILOT STOP, but it was too late, we took off,
 with someone who didn't know how to fly. I asked him how often this happened and he said ehh 60% of 
 plane flights were flown by people without any experience, and then later he corrected himself and said
  only 10% were, in an effort to make me feel better about the situation.
