    [redacted] was arguing with me about the quality of super market food and how it didn’t compare with freshly caught food. 
    We were in some sort of beaver hut, underwater, and he brought two meals, one fresh and one from the market,  Both were 
    lobster. I ate them both to humor his crazed delusional ranting, but was surprised that I was being fed this well, and lobster
     no less. I asked how he had transported the meals under the beaver hut, and he told me he constructed an elaborate tube system,
      he had put the food at one end of a very thin plastic tube on the surface, and when he got In the hut he sucked the food through
       the tube to retrieve it. 

    Or perhaps this was deep underwater. I have no idea… 
    I was responsible maintaining a school in the meantime, I had hired three janitors to keep the place clean,  At the end of the
     ordeal, I think it was at the end of the summer break, I celebrated with them with a bottle of jack Daniels and said if I get 
     to have some you guys get some as well. They were almost in tears as no other employer had treated them that well, I had gotten
      so drunk that I was having a hard time walking, and I knew this was a mistake because I had to drive home. I ended up just 
      giving them the whole bottle due to them mis-understanding what I had meant by me telling them I would share it, and to 
      compensate for this costly 20 purchase, I drank as much as I could. This scene ended with me and the crew walking out of 
      the highschool and through the parking lot as students flooded in for class. A story of accidental kindness.

I had a weird dream that I was spending time with toby from teh office, I showed him my phone for some reason, I showed him the files
 app on my phone and he accidentally saw what was clearly gay porn. Then for whatever reason I tried to ask him out on a date. I  asked 
 if it would be weird if we started dating.  or maybe it was Oscar I’m not sure. why the fuck am I having office dreams?
The other day I most certainly had a dream about toby from the office,  I don’t remember what led to it, but I do remember a scene where
 toby was holding  his head in his hands complaining of some sort of head ache, and then there was a quick cut to Michael Scott in the office
  handing him a gift with some random assorted pills in it, and said as a distasteful joke: "you're gonna need those!" and in my mind the 
  implication was that between the cut, toby  had a major mental break down and did something. the joke was that he would need pills or meds 
  since he was mentally ill.
