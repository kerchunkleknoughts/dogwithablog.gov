  Another dream where I am walking around campus, I was in a pool, watching my little pony, this was combined with meeting rooms,
   like a waterslide would go through the window of a meeting room and end in a pool, the pools were mostly empty, some of the support
    beams were flimsy looking, made of thin metal poles. IT was late, members of the board of the college were meeting. Some levels 
    were detected to growing plants, on the water slide and there wasn't any room for people to swim. I went to go on the top level,
     I think because I didn't want people to know I was watching mlp. There was just a pool at the top to hang out in

      
When I was there, suddenly the supports snapped, and several of the floors started to wobble, eventually collapsing. With board
 members, me and the water slide and all. I was worried since I might have harmed the board members, so I tried to hurry out of
  there. I left as soon as I could, and into a room that looked like a hospital waiting room, completely empty, with the dual door
   flaps. There was a board member sitting there, he said, you look like you are running from something, and he grabbed me before I
    could leave, he then started to lecture me, do you know who I am? Blah blah blah, he then pulled out a DVD and put it in a cd 
    player which was about all of his life accomplishment. How he built large portions of the school, and so on. I then said sorry I
     don't know who you are, but I have to get going maybe you don't understand my perspective and why I am running, then he smiled and
      said well okay maybe I could get to know you, report back here Friday with a page long essay on your perspective and why you are
       running, it was clear this man was trying to punish me somehow for the waterslide, or something, and I said no sir please I don't
        have time for this I'm an engineering student this will be too much on top of my workload, and he smiled and said ah yes I was an
         engineer once, he gave me his resume and I saw at the bottom he went to cornel, at this point I was getting mad, I said listen I
          need to get going, I don't have time for your essay so I am not doing it, and I could even fucking sue you for your waterslide
           giving out on me like that, and he was frowning now, I ran out as soon as I could, afraid he would track me down somehow, he
            had some administrative authority somehow I just knew he would get me expelled. The building was a labyrinth, I was trying to
             make it out so I could get to my car and go home. I ended outside somehow, but it was at the far end of the building, locked
              with fences, it was right up next to an elementary school yard,

 
The air was cold and the sky was full of stars. I remember looking at it with awe, and feeling refreshed.

 
 and I was trying to find a gap in the fence to leave, there were children running around as I tried to locate
  an exit. I saw [redacted] walking with Neal deGrasse Tyson, they were talking about science and advanced experiments
   far above my understanding and [redacted] was clearly Neal’s favorite student, I trailed behind them while they talked,
    they badged into the building, and I came in behind them. 

 
I kept trying to look for an exit, I remember going down a slide thinking it would get me closer to leaving but it
 turned out to be a laundry shoot, it led into a chamber with a giant spinning paddle, that was thrashing clothes about 
 and I spit out a huge wad of bubblegum to jam it before it could thrash and kill me. Of course I still couldn't get out
  the slide was too slippery.
