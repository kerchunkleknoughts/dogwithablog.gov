1-3-2025<br> 
One I was walking to my car, which was on the top of a hill, and I had a bunch of stuff with me, I had a fishing pole,<br> 
I was wearing the wrong kind of shoes, I think I had swimming shorts on, but despite all of these impairments I offered to<br>
 walk [redacted] to his bus stop which was out of the way just because I wanted to talk the whole way and show him I cared.<br> 

 <br> 


At the school in the first day of class I was in a science class room, the lights were dimmed and the teacher passed out<br>
 little about you quizzes for us to fill out, and there was also two cross word puzzles that he passed out to do as assignments.<br>
  They were balatro themed. For some reason, I found the puzzles really difficult, so I was avoiding working on one of them, <br>
  stalling, so people couldn't see how hard of a time I was having with them. Eventually I was one of the few left in class,<br>
   everyone was gone, they had finished because it was easy .  The lights were dimmed and there were a few clusters of students <br>
   just talking quietly. At one point the professor came over and said, are you going to work on this thing or keep slacking off?,<br>
    I apologized and said I'd work on it. <br>




    <br>  11-18-2024 <br> 

Had a dream that I got lost while driving around, so I decided to go downtown to sort myself out and find where I was. I ended up<br>
 driving to the airport, since I knew how to get home from a flight back to [redacted]. I was still in [redacted] when I stared the trip mind you. <br>

Anyway, When I got on the cockpit was empty and there was a sign that said the pilot was a minute late, I was standing next to an<br>
 air stewart, which was also looking at the sign, scratched his chin and said hmmmm, then just climbed into the cockpit despite not<br> 
 being the pilot. 

I screamed at him NO YOU ARE NOT THE PILOT STOP, but it was too late, we took off,<br>
 with someone who didn't know how to fly. I asked him how often this happened and he said ehh 60% of <br>
 plane flights were flown by people without any experience, and then later he corrected himself and said<br>
  only 10% were, in an effort to make me feel better about the situation. <br>
