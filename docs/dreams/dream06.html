I had a. Super vivid dream there was a school where students would always stay behind to study, many thought they were
 just dedicated students but after hanging around I was confronted with the truth, they had all died there and were ghosts. 
 Now the school administration was trying to run a school curriculum with a severe lack of resources since the headmaster 
 couldn't go out into the outside world to gather books for the dead. Many had died to suicide. 
 There was one guy who had stayed at the school because his lover died there, and they had a baby, but the baby ended 
 up wrong since it was a combination of ghost and living flesh, so it had to be killed

I had A dream that the default behavior of planes was changed they would first start going incredibly fast, 
impossibly fast forwards, then just leap vertically into the sky with no build up, I got on one of these planes and it happened. 
I was then at a party of some sort at a lounge, playing a spongebob themed chess with my girlfriend. All of the
 pieces were fucked up though, gory and abstract representations of spongebob characters. 
My girlfriend was laughing about the idea of the planes, laughing hard, then she started crying, I tried talking 
her into telling me what was wrong, and why she was crying. 
Same lounge, I was in the super villain lounge. I was outside, playing roguelike chess with a friend. There was an 
audience, like the [redacted] library there were people all about just casually sitting around. Some somewhat interested
 in the game most not. Like a coffee shop, 
I got an item combination that was extremely unfair, it would turn pieces that I captured into my pieces on the board. 
 when I won I was proud, and felt great, but knew it wasn't a true win due to random luck.
I was back in the lounge, it cleared out mostly now, I was sitting thinking about things at a table, then got up and
 ran into the owner of the shop, a old tall women. 
Then the dream ended.
