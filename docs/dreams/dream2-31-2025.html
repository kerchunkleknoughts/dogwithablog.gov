    Had a dream that I was part of a group of time travelers. We went back to the great depression. <br>
 
There was some earlier plot I don't remember. I think I was helping someone with something. I ended <br>
up in this person's house, with their family, looking around I saw that they had a small personal<br>
 computer, and was surprised since this was the great depression, I asked a little girl who was in<br>
  the house, his daughter or granddaughter, how do you guys have this this is the great depression.<br>
   It had a CRT screen, and a low refresh rate, you could see the refresh line travelling down the<br>
    screen.
Under the supervision of time Cops we were looking around<br>

 I was a little boy and I was talking to a little girl, and  I told her I was a time traveler,<br>
  she begged me to tell her something about the future but I said it was against the rules. <br>
  Eventually her begging broke me down and I waited for a moment away from the time police's eyes,<br>
   when we broke from their sight. There was a semitruck traveling with the crowd, and I tried moving <br>
   to the other side of it hoping there weren't any officers behind it, but there were. They looked like<br>
    un peacekeepers, same uniform, equipped with m16 rifles. Eventually me and the girl got in front<br>
     of the main group, we were traveling into a lush fall countryside at this point, and I told her<br>
      to invest in apple. A moment passed and then I told her again, computers... just in case she <br>
      invested in actual apples. As I walked, I was thinking about the year and realized that she <br>
      herself might not live to see my advice become anything useful, and that her grandchildren<br>
       might be the only ones who could use that information. I then began to worry that the advice <br>
       may never be useful, that she was just a little girl and she might forget. The countryside was<br>
        beautiful. There were rolling hills punctuated with lone trees, and the lane I was running <br>
        down was sometimes shaded with sections of trees. It was warm, and the trees were all changing<br>
         colors and the landscape was so colorful. I remember a hill with a single tree in the center,<br>
          and leaves arranged around it to look line swirls, or spirals. I was running along, running so<br>
           fast that I would sometimes trip and stumble. But I was running so fast that it didn't matter,<br>
            I would roll and get back up on my feet again.<br>
