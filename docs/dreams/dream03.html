  I had a dream that I was on a cruise ship or something of the sort, I was with a team of people tasked with shutting 
  down a criminal or something. Spy stuff. Or maybe it was just a large party I don't remember, there was a scene where I
   was climbing outside the building by holding onto the bricks of the building and spying in the windows into a large hall. 
The large hall had a party going on in it. [redacted] was there. He was dressed up in vacation clothes. He was glad to see me 
again but it was the sort if glad that was tinted with distrust. I was talking to him a little, he offered a drink to me, I didn't
want it because I knew I would feel like shit in the morning if I drank .
Then everyone started dancing in the large hall, I joined with one drink in my hands and started making up dance moves since
I didn't know how to dance. 
[redacted] saw and I was slightly embarrassed 
I think he had a girlfriend, there was a scene where we were talking where his girl came over and cozied up to him while we 
talked. That's when I was trying to ask how he'd been and how his life was .
I remember feeling a sting of jealousy because he had a girl and I didn't. He seemed like his life was great and 
figured out while I was just coming back for scraps of a social life, and I was the pathetic one, I was like a
beggar in tattered clothes pleading him to help despite the fact that I had turned my back on everyone and ghosted them.
