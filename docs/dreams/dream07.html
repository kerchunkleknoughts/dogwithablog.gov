    Had a dream that I was given a handgun that had both a little cigarette holder compartments, along with a lighter which shot a
     little plume of flame out of the front of the gun, and to light the cigarette you would need to point the gun at your face

    I was going out with a waitress after we met at a pizza restaurant. They kept fucking up my order, I never got the pizza, 
    I went to the restaurant as a break from my exam studies with the intention to come back We ended up going out to the mountains
     for a hike, we drove up there and there was a forest of  manikins like the cacti that cover New Mexico. We finally got to a 
     super steep cliff and positioned the car like a squirrel resting on a branch, the underbelly in contact with the mountain so
      it didn’t fall off the knife edge of the mountain. Later I woke up and realized it was a dream, that I had more time to study, 
      And I was wasting my time, but the waitress returned , and mocked me since she was a figment of my imagination and that she was a hallucination.

    last night I had a dream that me and [redacted] were in some sort of biomedical major together, and he had submitted a 
    project to the professor in front of me which was an anatomically correct model of the brain made out of clay, and the 
    professor, or he might have been an industry professional or something idk took a pair of tweezers and started ripping 
    apart the brain to see each layer below. prior to this I saw him greeting his girlfriend, with a kiss on the cheek after 
    [redacted]  had submitted the brain, the professional seemed very impressed, and I felt this horrible jealousy, but 
    soon after, when I was walking alone, his girlfriend had come up to me and kissed me and I thought well this is where 
    I can exact my revenge, by hooking up with his girlfriend
