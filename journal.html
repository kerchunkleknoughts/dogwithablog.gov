    its almost the end of winter break, I haven't written much in this journal lately. I'm on day 5 of my coffee detox, feeling 
    pretty good right now. Earlier on in the semester I cut back by a cup and now I am not drinking coffee at all. Feeling much
     more relaxed, but that could just be the effects of being on break.  I've spent a lot of my break just depressed honestly,
      not having any connections from the semester made it so that I didn't have anyone to do anything with. And forget being 
      outside, the weather is too damn cold to be out there. 
    Another thing I've been doing a lot of is just staring into space trying to figure out what I even want to do, Sometimes 
    I'll finish eating or finish up what I was doing previously and be at a complete loss as to what I should do with myself. 
    During the semester I've mostly filled my free time with video games and tv shows, but now that I have time off I feel
     like I really should be working on more fulfilling things, like some of my previous hobbies, like drawing or writing or 
     making stuff.  and sometimes I just don’t have the will to get into those things, but I have a feeling that  I want to 
     be working on that stuff. I guess just starting is really difficult. The problem I had  yesterday was that I wanted to 
     draw but didn't know what to draw, so I just reverted back to drawing more of the garden of earthly delights, knowing
      that it would probably just be good practice, starting. I think maybe thats the way to do it, just have like some 
      really easy practice material to start up with, like a warm up exercise, do that for like 15 minutes or 10 minutes,
       and then get into some of the hard stuff. Idk. 
    I am not looking forwards to capstone 2. the others will be fine, just in terms of the material,  but I am also not 
    looking forwards to the social aspect. I just fucking know that people are going to be terrible, I just know that 
    I'll try to make friends in class and it will fall flat on its face, its never worked out in my engineering classes 
    the people there fucking suck so bad.  I think that if I join a club and be consistent with it, maybe the running club,
     maybe I can get some friends at the end of the  semester. I want to do the running club, but I am a little afraid that
      they would leave me in the dust, or that it would be too hard since [redacted]
    I plan on doing a meeting this next Friday, see how it goes, and then if it doesn't work out the first time I will go
     over to the card game club. 
    I do really want to do the running club however, the running meetup I did around [redacted] seemed promising, it was
     all older people but if it was younger people I think I could get into it. 
    Plus when I mentioned my plan to [redacted] he said that he heard that running people are extra horny.  I don’t know
     where he heard this, but I looked it up and I guess some people report that they get  horned up after they run. on 
     reddit. If that has any validity, that could be a good way to have a little fun, I couldn't get the dating apps to
      work for attracting women and I just  really don’t want to go through with that for men. I don’t like the idea of
       meeting up with strangers until I've at least seen them a few times and feel comfortable with being around them,
        to make sure they are not  serial killers or will rob me or something.  plus there are plenty of ugly men out 
        there who kept hitting me up. wasn't a fan of that. 
    There is a strange pain in my ear, it sucks. 
    I was completely filled with dread yesterday thinking about returning to college, and the next four years of the 
     trump presidency. It should be okay overall, its a pretty balanced schedule but I still couldn't help it.  Sometimes 
     I think that I seriously need help, its my break and I've just been in bed most of the time,  I guess I just need to 
     learn how to effectively switch tasks because whenever I am working on something or  playing a game I feel okay, so
      maybe its just that I need to get better at getting into stuff, just starting.
